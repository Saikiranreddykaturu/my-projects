**My Snake Game** <br>

This repository contains the Python code for a classic Snake game with the following features: <br>

**Snake Movemen**t: Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right). <br>
**Food Consumption**: Grow the snake longer by eating the food items that appear randomly on the screen. <br>
**Scorekeeping**: Track your progress with the displayed score that increases with each eaten food item. <br>
**Collision Detection:** Game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. <br>
**Clean Code Structure**: The code is organized into separate Python files (snake.py, food.py, scoreboard.py) for better maintainability. <br>
